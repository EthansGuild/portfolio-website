    interpreter in Java which interprets a made-up language called Jott (combination of our professor's first 
    and last names, lol). In the first phase, we had to understand the DFA representing the language to 
    implement a Tokenizer in Java and report any Syntax Errors. For the second phase we built a Parse Tree 
    out of all of the tokens, which required making <i><u>a lot (27)</u></i> of \"Node\" classes to represent 
    each node in the CFG. In phase three, we decorated the Parse Tree with semantic analysis, and in the last 
    phase we executed/interpreted the code in Java. The image above shows our Symbol Table for the project which 
    helped SO MUCH with scoping and type checking.<br><br>

    feature matching, and applied algoirthms like SIFT and ORB to achieve some pretty neat results. The image
